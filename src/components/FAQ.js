        <h1>Insurance</h1>
        <p>
          Mariposa Wellness is an out-of-network outpatient physical therapy
          provider. This means that the client is responsible for paying the
          full fee at the time of service. We will issue a superbill that can be
          submitted by the client to their insurance for direct reimbursement.
          Each insurance company and plan is different. We recommend contacting
          your insurance company directly to find out what your coverage is for
          “outpatient physical therapy.”
