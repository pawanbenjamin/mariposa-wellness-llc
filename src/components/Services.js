            During pregnancy and in the postpartum phase, changes in hormones,
            the alignment of the pregnant person (and fetus), and the birthing
            process itself can potentially cause muscle, joint, nerve, bladder
            and bowel problems. At Mariposa wellness our goals for treatment
            during pregnancy and postpartum are to improve fetal and parent
            alignment to allow for greater ease with labor and delivery, and
            help accelerate the new parent’s recovery after childbirth.

          Our specialized Pelvic Floor Physical Therapists also treat conditions
          that are specific to the health of male urological and sexual
          function. For men, fascial restrictions in the pelvic floor and pelvic
          girdle can cause sexual dysfunction, difficulty with urination and
          bowel movements, or pelvic pain. Fascial restrictions in the male
          pelvis are often caused by poor postural alignment or scarring from
          abdominal or pelvic surgeries. Our Pelvic Floor Physical Therapists
          will help to reduce adhered scar tissue restrictions, and will also
          help to improve flexibility and normalize function to the urinary and
          reproductive systems.
